in this part, a real time entry fuction has been developed.
after the programme turtle2 has been executed, SDL window will shown on the screen,
if we entry a whole program in one time in the terminal, the result will be shown on the SDL window in real time.

An example:
{
DO A FROM 1 TO 100 {
SET C := A 1.5 * ; 
FD C
RT 62 
}
}
screen shot of the result is attached in the folder.
PS: a problem in extension is that the program can not be entered into the terminal line by line.
it can only be pasted into the terminal as a whole program.
